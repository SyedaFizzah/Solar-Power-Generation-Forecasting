# Solar Power Generation Forecasting using Deep Learning & Meta-Learning

### *(Teacher–Student Hybrid Architecture with Drift Detection & Explainable AI)*

This project presents a robust deep learning framework for **hourly solar power generation forecasting** using a hybrid **teacher–student stacking architecture**. The system integrates **CNN, LSTM, and TCN** sequence models as student learners, whose predictions are combined and passed to an **XGBoost teacher model** for high-accuracy meta-prediction. The approach significantly improves performance over traditional models and standalone deep learning architectures.

Additionally, the project includes **explainability (SHAP)**, **data drift detection**, and an interactive **Streamlit web application** for real-time forecasting and monitoring—making it suitable for industrial and utility-scale deployment.

## **Project Overview**

### Motivation

Accurate solar forecasting is essential for:

* Grid stability and load balancing
* Energy market trading
* Renewable energy integration
* Reducing carbon emissions and energy waste

Solar data is **highly nonlinear, seasonal, and weather-dependent**, making deep learning a strong candidate for improved forecasting accuracy.
